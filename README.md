CartWheels
==========

## Idea
- Plot all NYC food carts on a map, with other features... 

### Google maps
- We plan to use data from NYC Open Data and the Google Maps API to plot food carts on an interactive map

### Self Building Aspect
- Users of the application can give names to unnamed foodcarts (not businesses are named on NYC open data)

### Reviews
- Users can give yelp-like reviews to food carts

### Tags and photos
- Users will be able to give certain tags to food carts, and attribute certain photos to them as well

## Task delegation
- *Noah* -- website design and web pages
- *Vivian* -- middleware (app.py)
- *Judy* -- middleware and web pages
- *Ben* -- backend, js, and maps

## Uses
- NYC Open Data
- Google Maps API
- (Potentially) Yelp API
